 ## Description

_Welcome, welcome! To continue with the old addage of 'practice makes perfect' I present to you Routes & Stuff! I have been struggling with creating routes, modularization, and well...stuff! So here goes nothing! Join me on my never-ending quest for knowledge gathering while I try to create an application similar (but hopefully functional) to my dreaded nemisis Tech-Blog._ ðŸ˜¨

This application:
* will help me practice parts of the full-stack that I don't quite understand
* will help me redeem myself by taking past failures and growing from the knowledge gathered in said failure
